# Welcome to Tiny Dose App ðŸ‘‹

_An app created by a mom to other parents._

A simple and reliable way to calculate your child's Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen doses, following [Cheo's](https://www.cheo.on.ca/en/resources-and-support/p5325.aspx#:~:text=How%20much%20should%20you%20give%3F) expert recommendations.

We do **not** recommend that you give any medication to your child without consulting a healthcare professional first.

### Why use Tiny Dose App

As a mother of two young boys, I often found myself looking up CHEOâ€™s dosage recommendations and calculating medication amounts in the middle of the night. So, I decided to put my developer skills to work and build a simple toolâ€”for myself and for other parents who might be facing the same challenge.

## Development

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

### Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

### Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
